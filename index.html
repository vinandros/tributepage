              "El escenario no es para mí. Siempre fueron las otras cosas que lo rodeaban lo que nunca me sentí naturalmente.
              Todas las otras partes de ser un artista. Soy más una persona introvertida en general. 
              Siempre fue muy difícil para mí. Tomé demasiada energía negativa, creo."

          <h2 id="tribute-info">Here's a time line of Tim Bergling's life: </h3>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>1989</strong> - Tim Bergling was born in Stockholm on 8 September 1989, the son of 
                Klas Bergling and actress Anki Lidén. He started mixing in his bedroom at the age of eight.
                He had three siblings: David Bergling, Linda Sterner, and Anton Körberg. Inspired by his brother, 
                who was also a DJ.
              </li>

              <li><strong>2007</strong> - He began making music at the age of 16. In May 2007, Bergling signed on with the Dejfitts Plays label.
                 He was a member of the Laidback Luke Forums, where he refined his craft and, at times, demonstrated his distinct 
                 deep house style.
              </li>

              <li><strong>2009</strong> - Bergling was a prolific producer and was releasing music incredibly quickly. 
                His remixes during this period were "Sound of Now", "Muja", "Ryu" and "Even". Bergling explained that the name 
                Avicii means "the lowest level of Buddhist hell" and he chose the moniker because his real name was already 
                used upon creating his Myspace page.
              </li>

              <li><strong>2010</strong> - Bergling released the hit song "Seek Bromance", which reached the top 20 in several countries, 
                 including Belgium, France, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Sweden. He also remixed Nadia Ali's
                 classic single "Rapture" for her album Queen of Clubs Trilogy: Onyx Edition. In October 2010, Bergling signed with 
                 the European A&R team with EMI Music Publishing.
              </li>

              <li>
                <strong>2011</strong> - Bergling's track "Fade into Darkness" was sampled by Leona Lewis on her single "Collide". 
                The sampling was not accredited and led to controversy as Bergling attempted to block the single's release. 
                The matter was resolved out of court, with "Collide" being made a joint release between Lewis and Bergling.
                In October 2011, Bergling released "Levels", which launched him into the mainstream. "Levels" reached 
                the top ten in Austria, Belgium, Bosnia, Croatia, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, 
                Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Slovenia and the United Kingdom, whilst topping the charts 
                in Hungary, Norway and Sweden.
              </li>

              <li><strong>2012</strong> - His collaboration track "Sunshine" with David Guetta was nominated for a Grammy award under the 
                category for Best Dance Recording. On 23 March 2012, Bergling's unsigned single "Last Dance" was previewed
                on Pete Tong's show on BBC Radio 1. The song was later released on 27 August 2012. At Ultra Music Festival
                2012 in Miami, he premiered two tracks, "Girl Gone Wild" (Avicii's UMF Remix) with Madonna and "Superlove"
                with Lenny Kravitz. Bergling's UMF Remix of "Girl Gone Wild" was released on 20 April 2012, and "Superlove" 
                with Kravitz was released on 29 May 2012. After reaching two million followers on Facebook, Bergling released 
                a new song titled "Two Million". It was put out as a free download on his official SoundCloud page. On 27 April
                2012, Bergling released "Silhouettes". The song featured vocals from Salem Al Fakir and peaked at number 5
